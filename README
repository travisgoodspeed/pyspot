PySpot, a Python client for the SPOT Connect
by Travis Goodspeed <travis at radiantmachines.com>


This is a python library and client application for communicating with
the SPOT Connect, a satellite beacon for the GlobalStar constellation.

The protocol is similar to that described in Alexei Karpenko's
article[1], but the transmitter and language are different.  Expect
proper documentation soon.
