PySpot, a Python client for the SPOT Connect
by Travis Goodspeed <travis at radiantmachines.com>


This is a python library and client application for communicating with
the SPOT Connect, a satellite beacon for the GlobalStar constellation.
It expects the $SPOTCONNECT environment variable to be set to the MAC
address, which you can find using 'hcitool scan'.

The protocol is similar to that described in Alexei Karpenko's
article[1], but the transmitter and language are different.  Expect
proper documentation soon.

All commands are in the form AALLVV[data] where AA is the 0xAA preamble,

Verbs:
0x01 -- Get 4-byte ID.

0x40 -- Unknown.
